### This Git method script pushes all new commits from the current repository
### to all of its configured remotes (except 'upstream' which is considered a
### read-only common code repository). Usually this updates 'origin' and maybe
### some other local cloned repositories, if referenced.
### Then this pulls any updates from remotes, ensuring that this workspace
### has been replicated to remotes first, and then gets any refreshers from
### the remote repositories, and so the local sources are most up-to-date.
